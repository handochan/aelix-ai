# ``inspect.iscoroutine`` dance. The runtime (`_execute_and_finalize`) drains
# every scheduled emission before returning, mirroring Pi's
# ``await Promise.all(updateEvents)`` at ``agent-loop.ts:630``.
#
# Note: Pi ``AgentToolUpdateCallback`` is strictly sync (``void``); Aelix
# accepts ``Awaitable[None]`` for type-compat only — the runtime does NOT
# await user-returned awaitables (matches Pi semantics). Only the

    Sprint 3d (P-9) adds the optional ``on_partial`` callback. Pi parity:
    ``AgentToolUpdateCallback`` (``types.ts:357-358``) — fire-and-forget; the
    runtime guarantees every partial-emit fan-out is drained before the tool's
    final result is returned to the loop (mirrors Pi
    ``await Promise.all(updateEvents)`` at ``agent-loop.ts:630``).

    ``on_partial`` is ``None`` when no harness is registered (bare-loop
    callers); tools MUST tolerate the ``None`` value before invoking it.

    ``model`` is the resolved :class:`~aelix_ai.streaming.Model` for the
    current turn (Pi parity: ``ctx.model`` on the tool execute signature,
    ``agent-loop.ts``). It is ``None`` for bare-loop callers that do not
    thread a model through the loop; tools that read it (e.g. the read
    tool's non-vision image note) MUST tolerate ``None``. Typed ``Any`` to
    avoid a hard import coupling onto the streaming module.
